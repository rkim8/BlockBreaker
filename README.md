# BlockBreaker
In my rendition of Block Breaker (Arkanoid), the player will control his or her paddle with the left and right or A and D buttons on the keyboard to deflect the bouncing ball towards each block in the level. The same rule applies as the traditional Block Breaker game where the player must eliminate all the blocks without losing all of his or her lives in order to beat the level and progress. There are different kinds of blocks in this rendition, such as ghost blocks, which can only be hit when it is entirely visible. Power ups/downs may also appear randomly when a block has been destroyed. They can range from adding an extra ball to the game, giving an extra life, or making the paddle bigger or smaller. Each level is also timed, which means the player will have an additional challenge when progressing through the harder levels. if the user has earned a high enough score at the end of the game, he or she will get the chance to enter in their initials to be displayed on the high score chart.
